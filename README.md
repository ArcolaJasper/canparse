# canparse

[![crates.io](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/canparse)](https://crates.io/crates/canparse)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jmagnuson/canparse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jmagnuson/canparse)

A CAN signal and definition parser, written in Rust.

The goal of canparse is to provide a means of converting CAN frames into
pre-defined signals, via CANdb definition input ([DBC](https://vector.com/vi_candblib_en.html)).
One common application is the [J1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAE_J1939)
spec, which defines a set of common parameters for heavy-duty trucks and other vehicles.
`PgnLibrary` is also included as an application of DBC, to give first-class support for
the PGN/SPN schema.

## Usage

Add canparse to your `Cargo.toml` with:

```toml
[dependencies]
canparse = "0.1.1"
```

## Example

For a predefined DBC file, a simple program which utilizes `PgnLibrary` can be
implemented as folows:

```rust
extern crate canparse;

use canparse::{PgnLibrary, SpnDefinition, ParseMessage};

fn main() {

    // Parse dbc file into PgnLibrary
    fn lib = PgnLibrary::from_dbc_file("./j1939.dbc").unwrap();

    // Pull signal definition for engine speed
    let enginespeed_def: &SpnDefinition = lib
        .get_spn(&"Engine_Speed".to_string()).unwrap();

    // Parse frame containing engine speed
    let msg: [u8; 8] = [0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44, 0x55, 0x66, 0x77, 0x88];
    let engine_speed: f32 = enginespeed_def.parse_message(&msg).unwrap();

    println!("Engine speed: {}", engine_speed);
}
```

## Feature flags

- `use-socketcan` - Support for [socketcan-rs](https://crates.io/crates/socketcan)
has been included for Linux systems requiring a translation from `CANFrame` messages,
using `SpnDefinition` values.
